# simple-academy-projects

I was looking at the comments in the code and yeah I am probably not coming back to these programs for a long time. But maybe a good reminder for me lol, "the importance of good comments". Here is a short description of the projects, which is not as much a torture to read as the code :P

1. and-or-trees

* a simple data strucure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And%E2%80%93or_tree
* take user input to build one
* user input - A; B and C or D; E and F; G or H
*
* create the tree - 
* parent: A => children: B, and, C, or, D
* parent: B => children: E, and, F
* parent: C => children: G, or, H
*
* display as logical expression - ((E and F) and (G or H) or D)
* display output of the expression for custom input like E = True, F = False...

2. hospital-management-system ( classes and file handling )

* a staff class and a patient class
* a file to maintain staff and patient records
*
* two methods 
* one to allow a patient, access to the list of staff members
* another to allow a staff member, access to the list of patients

3. tournament-matchmaker

* build a circular queue for participants
* until a single winner is left, take details of winner from user for each match and update the circular queue
